# Clip It!
Clip It! is a fully automatic clipping software for VALORANT created in Python, utilizing [YOLOv8's object detection model](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) and a [custom dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/christalin-dorsey-ljvjf/simple-valorant-ui-detector)

# Purpose
Clip It! was initially developed to automatically gather timestamps for important global events within the game such as the start of a new round and when the spike gets planted for VOD review purposes. As the project evolved, additional features were incorporated to enhance its functionality such as the ability to clip entire rounds of a game, capture a player's own kills, and customizable settings to support these features.

# Key Features
- **Timestamps for Global Events:** The software automatically captures timestamps for significant global events, such as the start of a new round and the planting of the spike.
- **Clipping Entire Rounds:** Clip It! allows users to effortlessly clip and save entire rounds of a VALORANT game for analysis or sharing purposes.
- **Clipping Player Kills:** Players can easily generate clips specifically focused on their own kills, making it convenient for self-improvement and highlight reel creation.
- **Customizable Settings:** The software offers customizable settings, enabling users to tailor their clipping preferences according to their specific needs and preferences.
